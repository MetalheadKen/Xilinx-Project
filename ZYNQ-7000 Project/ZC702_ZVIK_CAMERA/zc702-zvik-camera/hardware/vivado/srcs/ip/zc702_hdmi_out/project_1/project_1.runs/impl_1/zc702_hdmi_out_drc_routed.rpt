2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
42 out of 42 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1]. Problem ports: xsvi_video_data_i[15:0], io_hdmio_video[15:0], clk, audio_spdif, xsvi_vsync_i, xsvi_hsync_i, xsvi_active_video_i, io_hdmio_spdif, io_hdmio_vsync, io_hdmio_hsync, io_hdmio_de, io_hdmio_clk.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
42 out of 42 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1]. Problem ports: xsvi_video_data_i[15:0], io_hdmio_video[15:0], clk, audio_spdif, xsvi_vsync_i, xsvi_hsync_i, xsvi_active_video_i, io_hdmio_spdif, io_hdmio_vsync, io_hdmio_hsync, io_hdmio_de, io_hdmio_clk.
Related violations: <none>

CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>
